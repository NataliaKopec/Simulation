( )1. Beam properties
( )1.1 Beam distribution in x, y, theta
( )1.2 Save initial beam to the file

( )2. Setup and geometry
( )2.1 Rotate the target
( )2.2 Update detector

( )3. Miscellaneous
( )3.1 Check x-section
( )3.1.1 Place small square detector e.g. 1x1cm^2 at some angle e.g. 80*deg
( )3.1.2 Check results with LISE++ - should have the same amount of events
( )3.2 Increase statistics - max nEvents = 2147483647 gives +/- 1000 events. More runs?
